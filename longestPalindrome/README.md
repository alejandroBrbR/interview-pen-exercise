# Longest Palindrome construction

Given a string, determine the length of the longest palindromic string that can be constructed from the stringâ€™s characters.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: "aabbc"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest palindromes possible are {"abcba", "bacab"}
```

### Example 2

```
Input: "abbcccd"
Output: 5
Explanation: The original string length is 7, but the longest palindromes are {"cbcbc",  "bcccb"}. 'a' and 'd' were not used.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: "xyz"
Output: 1
```
