/* 
Given a list of strings and a pattern string, return a list of all of the strings in the provided list that match the pattern of the pattern string.

Example 1
Input: words = ["aa", "bb"], pattern = "cc"
Output: ["aa", "bb"]
Explanation: Both strings repeat letters just as the pattern string does.

Input: words = ["aac", "bbc", "bcb", "yzy"], pattern = "ghg"
Output: ["bcb", "yzy"]

Input: words = ["aa", "bb"], pattern = "zy"
Output: []
